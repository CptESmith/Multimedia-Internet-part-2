Some info for Multimedia Internet part 2 exam:

The exam is gonna be 12 open questions with the same weight to do in 1 hour, so you have 5 minute per question.

No notes allowed.

There will be only text questions. You can write your answers directly in the text boxes in Forms. You can also write your answers on paper and scan and upload the papers at the end of part 2. Please decide which option you like better and stick to it, that is, do not mix answers in the text boxes in Formes and paper upload. Either you answer all questions on paper, or you answer all questions in the text boxes in Forms.

An oral exam will follow the written exam only exceptionally, and especially if there are doubts about the authorship of the submitted aswers. Normally, no oral exam is done.

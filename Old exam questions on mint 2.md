<ul>
<li>Show and example of how two media connection (audio+video) can be described in the SDP body of a signaling message.</li>
<li>Show and example of a tree topology of video streaming P2P system, given that the rate of the distributed video is 250 kbit/s and the capacity of the uplink of the user’s connection is 900kbit/s.</li>
<li>Assume that two H.323 networks communicate through a SIP network in an interworked architecture. Try hypotizing the possible exchange of messages to setup a call between two H.323 terminals, across the SIP network providing the interworking service.</li>
<li>Compare the procedures for the negotiation of media in SIP and H.323.</li>
<li>Describe the Softswitch architecture. List the signaling protocols used by the Softswitch architecture. Explain how these protocols interact to set up an interworked connection.</li>
<li>Describe the structure of SIP messages. Explain the function of Via headers. Explain the function of the Record Route headers.</li>
<li>Explain the differences and similarities between the IPTV and the Internet TV service.</li>
<li>Explain how it is possible to implement a scalable architecture to find resources (contents) in a peer-to-peer system.</li>
<li>Describe the technique that it is possible to use to build a Fiber To The Home Next-Generation Access Network.</li>
<li>Provide an example of RTSP interaction between a client and a media server to set up the straming delivery of a media.</li>
<li>Provide an example of an interworked call setup between an H.323 network and a SS7 network.</li>
<li>Discuss pros and cons of forest-based and mesh-based topologies in p2p video-streaming systems.</li>
<li>Provide an example of RTSP interaction that a client application must carry out to obtain the transfer of a multimedia content in a multimedia streaming fashion.</li>
<li>Outline and describe the high-level architectural scheme of a FTTH access network in both P2P and Passive Optical Network (PON) variants. Discuss the pros and the cons of the two solutions.</li>
<li>Discuss and provide an example of how SIP can interact with IP-level signaling to provide controlled end-to-end QoS for the established connections.</li>
<li>Take into account peers in peer-to-peer video streaming system with mesh/data-driven topology. List and describe the use and the meaning of the internal variables (data structures, metadata,…) used by peers in order to appropriately manage the exchange of segments/chunks.</li>
